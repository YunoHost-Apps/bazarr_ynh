Bazarr v1.4.0 has changed its configuration from ini to yaml format, forcing us to reset it.
Since this configuration file holds both the app's core settings but also your user settings, they will be unfortunately be reset too.

Sorry for the inconvenience! This will happen only this one time, hopefully.
